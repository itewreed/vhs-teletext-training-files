Pattern files generated by recording to a Panasonic NV-FS200 in SP mode and RF tapping the same VCR, digitising the signal using an unmodified white CX card using S-Video connector, at 8-Bit 28.636MSPS. Limiting the signal to 16MSPS using sox and flac encode it.
Decoding it using
```
vhs-decode input.flac <output> --system PAL --frequency 16.000000 --ct --threads 4 --recheck_phase
```
