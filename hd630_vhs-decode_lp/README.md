Pattern files for RF captures of LP (Long Play) recordings from a Panasonic NV-HD630 vcr, decoded by vhs-decode.

The decoding parameters used in vhs-decode are:

```--ct --clamp --sd```

vhs-decode version used: vhs_decode 0.2.6.dev33

A NV-HD630 was used to create the pattern table, but the resulting patterns probably also work for teletext decode of rf-captures from other vcrs.
